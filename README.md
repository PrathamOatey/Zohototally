# Zoho to Tally Data Migration Starter Pack

This starter pack provides a set of Python scripts and instructions to facilitate the migration of your Zoho Books/Creator data (exported as CSVs) into Tally ERP.

**Disclaimer:** This is a starter kit. While it aims to provide a robust framework, direct data migration always requires careful testing and validation. Tally's XML import functionality is specific, and minor discrepancies in data format or mapping can cause import failures. Always perform a test import on a dummy Tally company before importing into your live data.

## 1. Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following:

* **Python 3.x:** Installed on your system. You can download it from [python.org](https://www.python.org/).
* **Pandas Library:** A powerful data manipulation library for Python.
    ```bash
    pip install pandas
    ```
* **lxml Library:** For generating XML files in Python.
    ```bash
    pip install lxml
    ```
* **Your Zoho Backup ZIP:** Specifically, the `Plant Essentials Private Limited_2025-07-09.zip` file, which has already been extracted as per our previous conversation.
* **Tally ERP 9 / Tally Prime:** Installed and a *new, empty company* created for testing your imports. **Do NOT import directly into your live company data without thorough testing.**

## 2. Pack Contents

Upon unzipping this starter pack (once fully generated), you will find:

* `01_extract.py`: (Already executed) Handles extraction of the Zoho ZIP.
* `02_clean_map.py`: Reads Zoho CSVs, cleans data, and maps to Tally-friendly structures.
* `03_generate_tally_xml.py`: Generates Tally-compatible XML files for import.
* `04_batch_import_instructions.md`: Detailed steps for importing XML into Tally.
* `mapping_templates/`:
    * `ledgers_mapping_template.csv`: A template to define how Zoho accounts map to Tally ledgers.
    * `contacts_vendors_mapping_template.csv`: A template for mapping Zoho contacts/vendors.
    * *(More templates will be added for vouchers as needed)*
* `output/`: (Will be created by scripts) This directory will store the generated Tally XML files.

## 3. Getting Started

Follow these steps sequentially. It's crucial to verify the output of each step before proceeding to the next.

### Step 1: Extract Zoho Data (Already Done)

You've already performed this step. The Zoho backup ZIP file (`Plant Essentials Private Limited_2025-07-09.zip`) was extracted to `/mnt/data/zoho_extracted`. The `01_extract.py` script, if run, simply confirms this or performs the extraction if it hasn't been done.

**To re-verify or perform extraction (if starting fresh):**

Navigate to the directory where you will place these scripts and run:

```bash
python 01_extract.py
